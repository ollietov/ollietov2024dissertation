### Producing novel music with adjustable difficulty using AI
This repo contains the code, custom dataset and technical report for my university dissertation project focused on generating music with adjustable difficulty. The goal of this project was to see if it's possible for AI to generate music with various difficulty levels.
This approach could be used in the future to provide customisable AI-generated music for musicians to practice on.

**This project achieved a First (72%) grade.**
